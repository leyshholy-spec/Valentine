    </head>
        <h2>bonjour mon cheri!</h2>
    <body>
       <p>I haven't learned css yet, but I figured this could be a cute way 
        <br> to do this. </p>
        <h3>mi amor...</h3>
        <p>You came into my life so sudden yet so right
        <br>you've treated me just as I've always dreamed
        <br>the emotions you've made me feel gives me such delight
        <br>as sweet as the voice you let out in pleasure
        <br>my past relations could never measure
        <br><br>
        The knowledge you instill in me brings me so much joy
        <br> with your rants I never get bored
        <br>You have something special, I can see it
        <br>The whispers of my heart I could never ignore
        <br>The words you use to protect me, 
        <br>describe me,
        <br>seduce me,
        <br>enamor me.
        <br> I plan to use to nourish my soul and being
        <br> to help me grow into a woman with meaning. 
        <br> A woman who will love you unconditionally for all eternity.</p>
